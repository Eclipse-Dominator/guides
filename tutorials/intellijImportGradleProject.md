# Intellij IDEA: Importing a Gradle project

1. IntelliJ IDEA by default has the Gradle plugin installed.  If you have disabled it, go to `File` → `Settings` → `Plugins` to re-enable them.<br>
  If your project involves, similarly ensure the JavaFX plugin has not been disabled.
1. Click `Import Project` (or `Open or Import` in newer version of Intellij).
1. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
1. Click `Open as Project`.
1. Click `OK` to accept the default settings but do ensure that the selected version of `Gradle JVM` matches the JDK being used for the project.
