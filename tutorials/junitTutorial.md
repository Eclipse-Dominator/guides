JUnit is a testing framework for Java. By convention, java tests belong in `src/test/java` folder. A sample test file is included in this project. 

* To run a specific JUnit test class (e.g., `src/test/java/DukeTest.java`), right-click on the test class, and choose `Run {classname}`.
* To run all tests in a folder (e.g., `src/test/java` folder), right-click on the folder, and choose `Run tests in {folder name}`.
