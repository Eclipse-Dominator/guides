# Conventions for file/folder naming

## Files/Folders

* **General rule: aim for _local consistency_** i.e., follow the conventions/patterns followed by other files/folders in the neighborhood.
  * If the project uses a framework that has a specific file naming convention, follow that instead.
<p/>

* If there is no existing pattern to follow:
  * Use camelCase whenever possible. e.g. `formatsAndConventions.md`
  * If the name has multiple phrases, use - to separate phrases. e.g. `codingStyle-javaBasic.html`
<p/>

* Try to user common prefixes so that similar files appear together when sorted by name.<br>
  {{ good }} `codingStyle-java.html`, `codingStyle-html.html`<br>
  {{ bad }}: `javaCodingStyle.html`, `htmlCodingStyle.html`

* Prefer plurals if the file/folder contains multiple items of same type e.g. `docs` instead of `doc`
