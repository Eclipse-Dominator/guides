# Java logging conventions

We recommend using `java.util.logging` package for logging.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE`: A critical problem detected which may cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING`: Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO`: Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE`: Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.
